I have realized that I am unfortunately ailed by the same illness that took my brother and that I dedicated myself to solving it. All before perfecting the cure. This will most likely be my last entry due to death after I risk the medicine on my own body. It is my only hope to survive. If you are reading these then I am probably one of the numerous bodies surrounding the labs. I would've liked to have been remembered, but I do not think the world would take kindly to my experiments. I will leave my medical ID here as proof of my work and a testament to my life. It might help you to identify me.
