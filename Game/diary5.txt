Still no cure. I have begun to get headaches from the workload. I do not know if it is some form of karma for my actions. Many people have died in my experiments so far (No. 143 currently), however, it is all for the greater good. If only people would understand this is the only way to further push science! We cannot be weak-willed and allow ourselves to be bested!
