I have hit a bit of a wall. I saw massive progress at first but in my latest test (No. 67) it seems the cure stops the disease temporarily but doesn't cure it. The only way onward is to further test. It's all in the name of my brother. I hate to admit it but I am not even bothered by the testing process anymore. Desensitization is an interesting phenomenon.
